    // test coverage. Including the rest of the codebase (untested
    // React pages, controllers without behavioural tests) would
    // anchor the baseline near zero and make the threshold useless
    // as a regression gate.
    //
    // Policy: as new test suites land, ADD the new source file(s) to
    // this include list in the SAME PR — that's what turns the
    // coverage gate from a "catches deletions" backstop into a
    // forward-going invariant. Adding a file to the list means
    // "this code is guarded"; leaving it out means "untested, not
    // yet guarded".
    //
    // Thresholds sit a few points below the current measured values.
    // Intent is "catch obvious regressions" (test suite deletion, a
    // module refactored to bypass its guards), not enforce a
    // specific quality bar — premature precision here would make CI
    // flake on tiny diff-noise.
