  /* ── TRUST PROXY ──
     Production runs behind a reverse proxy (Render / Fly / nginx /
     Cloudflare). Without this, req.ip resolves to the proxy's loopback
     address — every per-IP rate limit (auth, contact, AI, payment,
     general) ends up keyed on the same IP for every user, so they all
     share one bucket. Setting trust proxy = 1 tells Express to read
     the FIRST entry in the X-Forwarded-For chain.

     The "1" is deliberate — DON'T trust the entire chain. A spoofed
     X-Forwarded-For header from an attacker becomes the perceived
     client IP otherwise; trusting only the immediate proxy means the
     attacker would need to be that proxy. (Set higher only if you
     genuinely run multiple stacked proxies you control end to end.)

     Also makes the session cookie's `secure: isProd` actually fire —
     express-session checks req.secure (which derives from req.protocol,
     which derives from X-Forwarded-Proto, which trust proxy enables).
     Without this, the cookie is silently dropped on HTTPS deploys
     because express-session sees req.secure === false. */

     Wire up the hardening that lives in middleware/security.js. This

     disabled with a stale "would break inline scripts" comment — the
     SPA's index.html actually has zero inline scripts (Vite emits
     external module bundles), so a strict CSP is fine. The same file
     also gives us tighter CORS (localhost regex + FRONTEND_URL only)
     and HTTP Parameter Pollution defence.

     Deliberately NOT wired: applyInputSanitizer. It strips substrings
     like "DROP TABLE" / "<script>" from request bodies, which mangles
     legitimate content (a forum post about SQL would lose words) and
     gives a false sense of security. Supabase's parameterised queries
     make string-level SQL-injection scrubbing unnecessary, and React
     handles XSS at OUTPUT — not at input. The right defence is
     schema-validation (Zod), not regex laundering of user data. */

     gzip (or brotli when the client advertises it) on every response.
     Phase 32 — Lighthouse against the local preview server showed the
     three-vendor + app + gsap-vendor JS chunks summing to ~440KB raw
     transferred. With compression that drops to ~140KB. Render's
     edge proxy DOES compress on its own, so on the live deploy this
     is partly redundant — but having it in the app layer means the
