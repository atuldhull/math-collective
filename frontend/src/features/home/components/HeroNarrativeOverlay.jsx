/**
 * HeroNarrativeOverlay — scroll-pinned narrative beats over the hero.
 *
 * Sits on top of whichever hero is rendered (the Three.js LibraryScene
 * or the future video-scrub variant), fading one short message in
 * and out as the user scrolls through bands of the 500vh hero spacer.
 *
 * Why bands instead of a continuous scroll-tied effect:
 *   Continuous mappings (opacity proportional to scroll) feel
 *   "scrubby" and never let any single message land. Discrete bands
 *   with explicit fade-in / hold / fade-out cycles give each beat
 *   its own breathing room and read like film title cards.
 *
 * Why rAF + ref-gated setState:
 *   Reading scrollY on every animation frame is cheap, but calling
 *   setState every frame would re-render the whole overlay 60×/sec.
 *   We only setState when the active band INDEX changes (handful of
 *   times per page load), so the React tree stays still between
 *   transitions.
